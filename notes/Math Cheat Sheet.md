# Math Cheat Sheet

## Percentages

### Percent of total: Calculate percentage of two numbers
$percent = \frac{number}{total} * 100$

**Eg.** Find the percent that $69/420$ represents

$percent = \frac{69}{420}*100$

$percent = 0.16*100$

$percent = 16\%$

### Amount from percent: Calculate the amount of something given the percent
$amount = total * 0.\%$

**Eg.** If you make 8% commission at your sales job, how much commission do you make if you sold $4213? 

$amount = \$4213 * 0.08\%$

$amount = \$337.04$

## Basic Statistics

### Mean/Average of a set 
$\frac{(Total\ of\ numbers)}{amount\ of\ numbers}$ 
**E.g.** `1,1,2,3,5,8,13`

$average = \frac{(1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13)}{7}$
$average = \frac{33}{7}$
$average = 4.7$   

### Median of a set 
The element in the **middle** of a set
**E.g.** `1,1,2,3,5,8,13`
`3` is the median as there are the same number of elements on each side

### Mode of a set
The element that appears the most often 
**E.g.** `1,1,2,3,5,8,13`
`1` is the mode since it's the only number that appears twice  

## Spatial Geometry
### Areas of polygons (2D Shapes)

- **Regular Quadrilaterals (Rectangles & Squares):** $a = b*h$

- **Parallelograms:** $a = b*h$

- **Triangles:** $a=\frac{b*h}{2}$

- **Circles:** $a=\pi r^2$
$\pi=3.14$

- **Trapezoids:** $a=(\frac{b+t}{2})*h$

### Volumes of Things 

- **Cylinders & Regular Prisms**
$area(base)*h$

- **Pyramids & Cones**
$\frac {area(base)*h}3$

## Exponent multiplication/division
When multiplying or dividing exponents, you add or subtract the exponent levels. 

- When multiplying, add the exponents
$x^5 * x^3 = x^8$
- When dividing, subtract them
$x^5 / x^3 = x^2$ 
## F(irst)O(uter)I(nner)L(ast)
Used to multiply the contents of brackets with two items each 
E.g $(7x + 3y)(8x + 5y)$

1. First - The first elements in each set of brackets  
(**7x** + 3y)(**8x** + 5y)
$56x^2$

2. Outer - The outermost elements when observed together
(**7x** + 3y)(8x + **5y**)
$35xy$

3. Inner - The innermost elements when observed together
(7x + **3y**)(**8x** + 5y)
$24xy$

4. Last - The last elements in each set of brackets
(7x + **3y**)(8x + **5y**)
$15y^2$ 

Then combine these elements together
$56x^2 + (35xy + 24xy) + 15y^2$
$56x^2 + 59xy + 15y^2$ 

## Unit Conversion
When converting from 1D to 2D, you must divide/multiply twice. 
### Converting from sqare inches to square feet
$144in^2 = 1ft^2$

$(144in^2/12in/ft)/12 = 1ft^2$

$12/12 = 1ft^2$ 

## Probability

When calculating the number of outcomes when elements can't be reused, multiply the number of items in the set times itself -1
Eg. How man ways can the following set be arranged? `{1,2,3,4}`
$combinations = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24$
> This is called a factorial and is represented by `!`
> **Eg.** $4!$ = $4 * 3 * 2 * 1$
